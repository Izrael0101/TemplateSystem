## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

 The project 'TemplateSystem.Web' is ASP.Net MVC which uses the Model present in 'TemplateSystem.Entity'. The Controller uses the 'TemplateSystem.Services' for business operations using async operations. The async CRUD operations are being done using Entity Framework from 'TemplateSystem.Repository'. 
 
  Highligts
 ----------
 The main points are the following:-
 1. The connection string is mentioned in the Web.Cofig file of 'CG.StarSystem.Web'
 2. The 'TemplateSystem.Web' doesn't have any direct connection with the Repository or the database. It only depends on Application          Services and Entity.
 3. All operations are Async from Controller --> Services --> Repository --> Entity Framework
 4. Dependency Injection in ASP.NET MVC using Unity IoC Container. The Repository layer has been deliberately left out for flexibity of     replacing.
 5. Entity Models are resued across layers.
 6. Unit of Work is automatically taken care by Entity Framework.
 

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should element DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have have contributed to expanding this template!
